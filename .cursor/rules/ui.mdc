Lighting: Soft diffused studio lighting, subtle drop shadows for depth, silky smooth texture. Layout: Organized Bento grid system. High definition, 8k, photorealistic, trending on Dribbble, UX/UI masterpiece.

Additional UI constraints for this repo:
- Prefer monochrome palette: `#FFFFFF`, `#F2F2F7`, `rgba(60,60,67,0.6)`; avoid vivid gradients.
- Cards must be responsive and fill width by default; avoid center-stacked narrow cards.
- Layout: fixed top navigation; fixed bottom action bars where present; only the middle content area scrolls when overflow.
- Prevent overflow: add `min-width: 0`, `box-sizing: border-box`, and safe line wrapping for long text/content.
